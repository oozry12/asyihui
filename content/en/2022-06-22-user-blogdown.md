This afternoon I will give a talk at the useR! 2022 conference on blogdown.
Since I need to show a few live demos, I thought I'd better pre-record it just
in case, which I did yesterday. If anyone is interested, you can find [my slides
here](https://slides.yihui.org/2022-useR-blogdown.html), and the video [on
Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/722781853).

I hope you will find it useful. Looking forward to more websites and blogs from
useRs!
