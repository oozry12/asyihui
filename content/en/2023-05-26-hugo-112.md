title: Please Avoid Using Hugo v0.112.x

To new **blogdown** users: the current latest Hugo version 0.112.x series have
some [serious bugs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/11018) and I'd
strongly recommend against using these versions of Hugo. For now, the highest
version of Hugo that you can use is 0.111.3, which you can install with:

``` r
blogdown::install_hugo('0.111.3')
# if you have installed higher versions, you can use
# blogdown::remove_hugo() to remove them
```

For old **blogdown** users, you don't need to worry about anything because you
are likely to have already installed an older working version of Hugo, and
pinned it in your `.Rprofile` (if not, `blogdown::check_site()` can tell you
how).

In general, there is no need to upgrade Hugo if a certain version works fine for
you.

Hopefully these Hugo bugs will be addressed in v0.112.4 soon.
