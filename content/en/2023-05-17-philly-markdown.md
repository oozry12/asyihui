Tomorrow I'll give a webinar at 10am (US Central Time) at the ASA Philadelphia
Chapter on R Markdown v1. If anyone is interested, you may [register for the
webinar
here](https://drexel.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcscOiopjIvHdwwE6VEyT8JVJhno0x5YjIh).

I have done [a similar webinar](/en/2023/01/minimal-r-markdown/) in January, but
this time I will explain more on why the almost deprecated R Markdown v1 was
revived, and show more interesting applications. Like the last time, I don't
think this talk will be useful to a large audience, so personally I wouldn't
recommend you to attend it unless you are sure that you are interested. You can
[read my slides](https://slides.yihui.org/2023-philly-markdown.html) in advance
to make the decision.
