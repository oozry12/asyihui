Last year my colleague Christophe suggested that I add a table of contents and
anchor links on [the FAQ page of **tinytex**](https://yihui.org/tinytex/faq/)
([#94](https://github.com/yihui/yihui.org/issues/94),
[#95](https://github.com/yihui/yihui.org/issues/95)), which were definitely good
ideas. This week I took some time to reorganize my [miscellaneous JavaScript
code](https://github.com/yihui/misc.js), learned a little bit about NPM, and
published my scripts as [a Node
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xiee/utils).[^1]

[^1]: This is not really a normal Node.js package. Most scripts are
    self-contained and are for side-effects in browser only. My motivation of
    publishing them anyway is to be able to use jsdelivr.com.

During this process, I wrote another little script to convert an ordered list on
an HTML page into a collapsible FAQ list. Basically, all you need to do is load
the script and stylesheet in your HTML or (R) Markdown document:

``` html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xiee/utils/css/faq.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xiee/utils/js/faq.min.js" defer></script>
```

## Demo

Below is a quick demo:

1.  **What's the answer to life, the universe, and everything?**

    [42.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)

2.  **Who is Frida Gomam?**

    This clever lady:
    <https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9u22lb/frida_gomam/>

3.  **How to quit vim?**

    But why?

You can click on each question to reveal or hide its answer. Or click on the âŠ•
button at the top-right to expand/collapse all answers. When you mouse over a
question, its anchor link (denoted by the `#` symbol) will become visible at the
end. You can use the link to point to a specific FAQ item, e.g.,
<https://yihui.org/tinytex/faq/#faq-3>.

## Selection of ordered lists

This JS program looks for all ordered lists (`<ol>`) on a page, and turns a list
into an FAQ list if it satisfies the following conditions:

1.  It either has no `class` attribute, or contains an `faq-list` class;
2.  Each of its child element contains at least two child elements (the first
    one is the question, and the rest is the answer);
3.  It is a direct child of `<div>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, or `<article>`, and
    the container does not have the `footnotes` class (to avoid accidentally
    converting footnote items into FAQ lists).

For example, the above ordered list was ignored by this program because its
child items only contain one child.

## Styling

A class `faq-list` will be added onto the `<ol>` element, and you can style the
list using CSS rules if you are not satisfied with the default minimal styling.
For example, since it is Halloween, let's make the list a little spooky:

``` css
<style type="text/css">
.faq-list > li {
  border-color: ghostwhite;
}
.faq-list > li > :first-child, .faq-button {
  background: darkorange;
  color: ghostwhite;
  font-family: Papyrus, fantasy;
}
</style>
```

<script>
(() => {
  const s = document.currentScript;
  s.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', s.previousElementSibling.innerText);
})();
</script>

Then you get an orange theme like this:

## Related work

This JS application was inspired by [Jiena's awesome **faq**
package](https://github.com/jienagu/faq), which is an HTML widget package that
allows you to create an FAQ list from a data frame in R. You can use it in
either R Markdown or Shiny apps. Thanks Jiena![^2]
