Recently I often hear my son sing a song at home that sounds touching to me. The
incomplete lyrics from his mouth included sentences like "remember there are
people not as fortunate as you". That's exactly what I have been telling him
since he was four years old when he complained about the food on the table (be
thankful as long as you have something to eat, because there are still people in
the world who suffer from hunger).

I asked him what song it was, and he told me it was "Goodwill". I have never
heard of it, and didn't find it via Google, either. Then he told me it was
written by his teacher, which explains why I couldn't find it. So I asked his
teacher, who told me it was written by Teresa Jennings titled "[Share Your
Goodwill](https://www.musick8.com/html/current_tune.php?numbering=52&songorder=4)".
I was able to find it within seconds after I learned that.

> When you have a place to sleep at night,  
> when you have some food to eat,  
> when you have a coat to keep you warm,  
> and shoes upon your feet,  
> remember there are people  
> not as fortunate as you.  
> Remember they might need your help.  
> You know what you can do.
>
> You can share your goodwill.  
> Oh, share your goodwill.  
> Oh, keep in mind humankind  
> and share your goodwill.  
> You can share your goodwill.  
> Oh, share your goodwill.  
> Oh, keep in mind humankind  
> and share your goodwill.
>
> When you have a school to teach you things,  
> when you have a chance to learn,  
> when you have a job, a livelihood,  
> a way for you to earn,  
> remember there are people  
> not as fortunate as you.  
> Remember they might need your help.  
> You know what you can do.
>
> Share your goodwill!  
> Share your goodwill!  
> Oh, keep in mind humankind and  
> share your goodwill!  
> You can share your goodwill!  
> Share your goodwill!  
> Oh, keep in mind humankind and share,  
> oh, share your goodwill!  
> Your goodwill!

I really love this song. I guess most adults must have sung a song like this one
in our childhood, yet when we grow up, we still need things like the "Code of
Conduct" everywhere...

It also reminds me of this line in "The Great Gatsby":

“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one [...] just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.”
